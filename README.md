## Overview
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
1. I needed to seee things easier , added divs and the proper html to everything in the doccument giving buttons to buttons and links to links .
2. I neded to know what I needed to do so I wrote down what needed to be done. 
3. I will now move top to bottom and fix the code to fit the website shown
    -I added the images first since i will be working around those images 
    - i then moved the content and information around that  picture 
4. I then went line by line and added spacing and flex boxes around more things that needed flex boxes
5. Then after that I moved to the bottom of the screen to the footer 
    - I lined up everything down there 
    -  changed the color of the font 
    - added filters in the css code and made theimages change color when you hover them. 
6. I then went back and changed the font colors and fixed small problems I went through during the duration of the code, 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

I learned alot more about bootstrap and made more progress than I thought I would. However the font I was given wasnt the same as the font I was working with since if i used that font, It would of changed the website into something that would be completly unreadable. I also am curretnly trying to learn and understand the filter function since I really do not get that and it is really confusing. I need to research more if there is an easier way than the way i did in the  code.  I ended up using a codepen to translate it after long research. 



### Continued development

To continue developing skills in this the next few projects I might use bootstrap to get better at using it .

## reflection 

###Write a brief reflection (100-200 words) discussing:
    - Challenges you encountered during the project.
    - Your approach to solving these challenges.
    - Improvements you would make if given more time.
The biggest challenge I had was making the filters, and using bootstrap to make the code using the restrictions that bootstrap gives. My approach to fix these problems were to look them up and see examples of them to understand whats goinng on. After looking it up i try to put it in the code. I wish that i could figure out how to be more persice in the cooding.
